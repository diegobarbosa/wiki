<p>The article presents a compiled list of unit tests naming strategy 
that one could follow for naming their unit tests. The article is 
intended to be a quick reference instead of going through multiple great
 pages such as following. That said, to know greater details, please 
feel free access one of these pages listed below and know for yourself.</p>

<p>Following are 7 popular unit tests naming conventions that are found 
to be used by majority of developers and compiled from above pages:</p>

<ol><li><strong>MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior</strong>: There 
are arguments against this strategy that if method names change as part 
of code refactoring than test name like this should also change or it 
becomes difficult to comprehend at a later stage. Following are some of 
the example:
<ul><li>isAdult_AgeLessThan18_False</li>
<li>withdrawMoney_InvalidAccount_ExceptionThrown</li>
<li>admitStudent_MissingMandatoryFields_FailToAdmit</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>MethodName_ExpectedBehavior_StateUnderTest</strong>: 
Slightly tweeked from above, but a section of developers also recommend 
using this naming technique. This technique also has disadvantage that 
if method names get changed, it becomes difficult to comprehend at a 
later stage. Following is how tests in first example would read like if 
named using this technique:
<ul><li>isAdult_False_AgeLessThan18</li><li>withdrawMoney_ThrowsException_IfAccountIsInvalid</li><li>admitStudent_FailToAdmit_IfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>test[Feature being tested]</strong>:
 This one makes it easy to read the test as the feature to be tested is 
written as part of test name. Although, there are arguments that the 
“test” prefix is redundant. However, some sections of developer love to 
use this technique. Following is how the above tests would read like if 
named using this technique:
<ul><li>testIsNotAnAdultIfAgeLessThan18</li><li>testFailToWithdrawMoneyIfAccountIsInvalid</li><li>testStudentIsNotAdmittedIfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Feature to be tested</strong>:
 Many suggests that it is better to simply write the feature to be 
tested because one is anyway using annotations to identify method as 
test methods. It is also recommended for the reason that it makes unit 
tests as alternate form of documentation and avoid code smells. 
Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using 
this technique:
<ul><li>IsNotAnAdultIfAgeLessThan18</li><li>FailToWithdrawMoneyIfAccountIsInvalid</li><li>StudentIsNotAdmittedIfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Should_ExpectedBehavior_When_StateUnderTest</strong>:
 This technique is also used by many as it makes it easy to read the 
tests. Following is how tests in first example would read like if named 
using this technique:
<ul><li>Should_ThrowException_When_AgeLessThan18</li><li>Should_FailToWithdrawMoney_ForInvalidAccount</li><li>Should_FailToAdmit_IfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>When_StateUnderTest_Expect_ExpectedBehavior</strong>: Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using this technique:
<ul><li>When_AgeLessThan18_Expect_isAdultAsFalse</li><li>When_InvalidAccount_Expect_WithdrawMoneyToFail</li><li>When_MandatoryFieldsAreMissing_Expect_StudentAdmissionToFail</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Given_Preconditions_When_StateUnderTest_Then_ExpectedBehavior</strong>:
 This approach is based on naming convention developed as part of 
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). The idea is to break down the tests 
into three part such that one could come up with preconditions, state 
under test and expected behavior to be written in above format. 
Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using 
this technique:
<ul><li>Given_UserIsAuthenticated_When_InvalidAccountNumberIsUsedToWithdrawMoney_Then_TransactionsWillFail</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>My personal favorite is naming unit tests based on the writing 
features of the class under test. It helps me to make sure that a class 
follows single responsibility. It also aids a great deal in code 
refactoring.</p>
